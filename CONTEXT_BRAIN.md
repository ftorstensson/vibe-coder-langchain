## THE BRIDGE (SUMMARY)

**PREVIOUS MISSION:** "Mission 6: The Shared Understanding"
**STATUS:** **TOTAL SUCCESS.** The Agency has a Memory, a Voice, and a Face.
**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
1.  **Memory Solved:** Implemented `CustomFirestoreSaver` with Time-Sortable IDs to fix Amnesia.
2.  **Visual Board:** Created a Real-Time Project Board (Split-Screen UI) connected to Firestore.
3.  **Protocol Hardening:** Implemented `GeminiToolAdapter` and `HumanMessage` wrapping to stop Gemini 2.5 crashes.
4.  **Strict Standards:** Updated Agent Personas to enforce `frontend/` paths and TypeScript.

**NEXT MISSION:** "Mission 7: The Builder"
**OBJECTIVE:** Now that the infrastructure is bulletproof, we focus on the **Quality of Code**. We will test the "Head of Frontend" to ensure it builds working, error-free Next.js applications on the first try.
